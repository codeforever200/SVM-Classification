# SVM-Classification
This is an implementation of Linear SVM Classification model. A Social Network Advertisement dataset has been used here which consists of three columns. The first two columns are the independent variables, namely the ‘Age ’and the ‘EstimatedSalary’ and the last column is the dependent variable ‘Purchased’, which is in the binary format denoting whether the individual has bought the product (1) or not (0). A SVM Classification model has been made that will classify whether a user of a particular age and with a particular salary will buy the given product or not.
